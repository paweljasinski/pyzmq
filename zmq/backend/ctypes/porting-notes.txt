Porting consideration.


Ironpython, same as Jython, uses unicode strings. str, unicode and byte behave
in a way consistent with cpython 3.x. However entire standard library acts in
2.7 way. 
Most of the python code already accounts for the the differences between 2.x and
3.x, unfortunately either way it will not work under ironpython.

There are 2 choices: use 2.7 mode and try to patch things around str/unicode
transition or use 3.x mode and stub all the api calls to accept 3.x parameter
or produce 3.x return values.
